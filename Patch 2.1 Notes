Version 2.1 
________________________________________

Summary: Huge patch to fix many bugs from Version 1.0 and Version 1.5. No new features added as of yet, patch was purely to iron out bugs and fix aesthetics. This should be considered the first real working version of the game.

Bug Fixes and Improvements: 

-Improved High Score System to not allow negative values and add more overall points. 
-Removed Annoying/Loud Tap Sounds and replaced them with softer Synth notes. 
-Removed Credits Page completely to work out a new design (will be back in a future update).
-Fixed 'Play Last' bug to not play when the game is lost.
-Fixed 'Play Last' bug to not accept input when the game is lost.
-Added higher bit and more modern shapes. 
-Fixed the bitmap error that was causing edges to be distorted around shapes.

Things to be done:

-Menu music plays constantly even when app is idle, needs to pause when app is in the background or when phone is off. 
-Need options to toggle a mute for in-game and main menu music. 
-Additional backgrounds and a 'stage selection' prompt which changes the stage backgrounds would be nice.
-Respective music for each stage. This also means that music needs to be added while the game is ACTIVE, right now it is silent and feels bad man.
